# DanceDestination 

[***DanceDestination***](http://mydancedestination.com/) 
came to life because of my passion for dance and music! 
I am a multicultural dancer and finding dance events based on their music genre has been a challenge. 
Finding Hip Hop dance event is easy, but other styles dance event is challenging. I designed and created 
DanceDestination, so every person can specify the music genre first and search for dance events based on that.
